It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book

This book is a complete package for you to build real-time web applications. You will build an end-to-end social networking web application from development to production with Angular as the frontend and Firebase as the backend.

You will create an application called Friends with authentication, friends, and chat features. During the process, you’ll use Firebase authentication to register new users and Firebase database to store your extra user data. You’ll take a look at how to store and retrieve your user's images from Firebase storage. Then, you’ll create a real-time chat module with the Firebase database. Next, you’ll secure your database using Firebase security, make your application live with Firebase hosting, and develop your application with analytics.
